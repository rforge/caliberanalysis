CALIBERfma version 0.1-0
==================================================

This is the first version of a R package to make it
easier to use and develop the Freetext Matching
Algorithm. It has functions for invoking the algorithm
(a compiled Visual basic 6.0 program) to analyse text
in a flat file or as an R object, and return the result
as an R object.
