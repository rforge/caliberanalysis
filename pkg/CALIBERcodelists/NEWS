==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.2-1
(second version on R-Forge)
==================================================

NEW FEATURES

- ability to use the ICD-9 to Read mapping

BUG FIXES

- shortname and description are interchanged when
  extracting from META (master dictionary)

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.2-0
(first version on R-Forge)
==================================================

CHANGES

- the assignmetadata function is not longer exported
  for simplicity; users are expected to use the
  setMetadata function and this is now the only
  metadata assignment function documented.
- added in the main menu, the option to process an existing
  Rmd file, or to convert a codelist to the standard format
  (which will automatically load it, ask you for metadata
  and save it using the standard name.)
- ignore a column named 'termlc' when importing a codelist
- add documentation about how best to use the package with
  Stata.

BUG FIXES

- Missing line break character at the end of export
  statement (thanks to Joshua for spotting)
- Recognise dd.mm.yyyy and dd.mm.yy date formats
- fix a bug in importing ICD-10 codelists with a blank
  medcode column.

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.1-9
==================================================

BUG FIXES

- type conversion error when importing a codelist to
  the master dictionary
- incorrect R copying of a data.table in export()

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.1-8
==================================================

NEW FEATURES

- allow setdictionary to initialise the master
  dictionary using an existing codelist (thank you
  Harriet for the idea)
- add people who have tested the package as official
  "contributors" (role "ctb")
- codelist function allows non-case-sensitive
  detection of readcode, readterm columns, and
  non-standard versions such as icd, icdcode,
  opcs, opcs.Code, read_code
- allow comparison of the codelist under construction
  with another codelist interactively
- a codelist format for drugs, from CALIBER_PRODDICT
  (no interactive mode yet); the source dictionary
  codename is 'GPRDPROD'. The code column contains
  the Multilex code (thanks Kate for suggesting)
- allow 'ONS' as a type of ICD-10 codelist, to allow
  different sets of codes to be used for HES and ONS.
  ONS codelists can be exported using demo(makecodelist)
  but not demo(explore). The difference between a HES
  and ONS codelist is the name suffix and the Source
  attribute.
- documentation to explain the menus in more detail,
  including which menu links to another

BUG FIXES

- export did not contract ICD-10 codelists, fixed.
- ensure that entries in the categories table are
  not duplicated (keep only one per category number)

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.1-7
==================================================

MAJOR CHANGES

- new setMetadata function (suggested by Joshua)
  to alter the metadata for a codelist

IMPROVEMENTS

- in introduction document, add more examples for
  regular expressions, including comparison with
  Stata strmatch or GPRD Medical term browser
  (thanks to Emily for suggesting)

BUG FIXES

- loading a Stata DTA codelist results in an error
  if the variable names are different from the label
  names, because the importDTA function did not check
  if they were different.
- fixed error on trying to export a codelist with
  NULL Name (thanks to Joshua for picking it up); test
  added in the export example.
- categories are incorrect if they contain non-ASCII
  characters (problem with acute psychosis codelists,
  now non-ASCII characters in category labels are
  converted by iconv.)

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.1-6
==================================================

BUG FIXES

- if there exists an object named 'temp' in the global
  environment and an attempt is made to create a
  codelist out of something that is not a codelist,
  temp is returned instead. This was an error in the
  codelist function, which has been fixed.
- 'identical' S3 method for codelists did not work so
  it has been removed.
- when loading a codelist format object, extra
  categories were created from blank rows in the
  metadata column, because sub was used instead of
  gsub in extractMetadataFromColumn

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.1-5
==================================================

MAJOR CHANGES

- dictionaries are now in a separate CALIBERlookups
  package, so that the main package can be distributed
  separately from the lookups
- renamed dictionaries CALIBER_DICT, CALIBER_DICTMAPS
  so that they are less likely to conflict with other
  objects in the user's workspace
- codelists are saved under a new standardised naming
  system <name>_<source>.codelist.<version>.csv
- Markdown files can end in .Rmd.txt (may be easier
  on Windows)
- the 'process' function sutomatically invokes showhtml()
  in a Markdown document if there is no other showhtml
  in the document. Also R output is not shown by default.

IMPROVEMENTS

- a detailed user guide (suggested by Mar and Emily)
- modified the Stata export format so that it puts
  metadata in the datalabel field rather than in a
  column
- option in 'process' whether to include R output in 
  HTML document (thanks to Mar for suggesting)
- can supply custom CSS for the process function, and
  the default CSS has been changed (suggested by Mar)
- 'compare' function also compares metadata and the
  category table, but by default only reports
  the number of terms changed
- the program confirms that the version number is a
  number
- package version is retrieved from the package itself
  rather than being hard-coded
- new 'identical' S3 method for codelists uses the
  compare function
- more sensible object names suggested by iAskName
- interactive mode does not ask to export empty
  codelists
- interactive browser warns if not showing the entire
  list (suggested by Emily)

BUG FIXES

- corrected errors in browseDICT (thanks to Emily
  and Kate for reporting) 
- undo in interactive mode would cause an error if 
  there was only one selection statement 
- convert did not work with a selection, now fixed
- fixed a bug in showing empty ICD10 categories in
- remove Warning message: In retrieveCategoriesFromMETA()
  showhtml : NAs introduced by coercion

==================================================
Changes in CALIBERcodelists version 0.1-4
==================================================

IMPROVEMENTS

- more flexible management of selections
- menu-driven system for manipulating codelists
- separate functions for browsing selections
  (and manually excluding terms), for browsing a codelist
  under construction in the main dictionary
  (and assigning categories) or browsing an existing
  codelist (which has nothing to do with DICT).

BUG FIXES

- makecodelist demo had the wrong filename for R script file
- error in category updates after using browsedict

TODO

- installation guide for Windows
- introduction to Read, OPCS and ICD-10 codes
- vignette for making a codelist
