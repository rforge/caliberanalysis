Version 0.1-2
===================

CHANGES:

-   textid now defaults to numbers rather than text strings
-   Lookup table specification in doseconvert altered; now there is an
    option to supply only a single lookup table (customlookups) or use
    the built-in lookup table (option usebuiltinlookups = TRUE)
-   Some corrections to lookup tables
-   New option maxifchoice, whether to return maximum or average
    dose if there is a choice of dose. Returns maximum dose by default
-   Modified testdoseconvert function - now uses the same arguments
    as doseconvert, and can compare the results with a gold standard
-   Added 'combined' as a return option for multiple doses combined
    into a single dose
-   Corrected the function for combining multiple dose lines
