=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-10
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- Ensure that addToCohort works if there are some
  missing indexdates

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-9
=================================================

CHANGES:

- Box area instead of box width is now proportional
  to inverse variance in multiforest
- removeVariables added as an alias of removeColumns
- transferColumns added as an alias of transferVariables
- addCodelistToCohort can use ONS & HES (ICD-10 and OPCS)
  datasets
- overwrite is TRUE by default in both addToCohort and
  addCodelistToCohort (previously inconsistent)
- summary.cohort produces a neater display
- importDT and importFFDF clean up their temporary files

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-8
=================================================

CHANGES:

- No warning if unable to convert text to date (previously
  this would produce warnings with importDT because
  the function tries to convert every text column
  to date).
- Added decimal.mark as an argument to formatnum, to
  allow different options for decimal points.
- New arguments defaultboxcolour and defaultlinecolour
  for multiforest
- formatnum no longer gives warnings for missing values
- When transferring variables between cohorts,
  the description is also transferred
- transferVariables now has an option of 
  removing variables from the dataset they are
  transferred from
- importDT can now handle gzipped files (they are imported
	directly with read.table and fread = FALSE)
- date column can now be extracted as the value
  of interest using addToCohort (previously not
  possible if it had the same name as the event
  date column)

BUG FIXES:

- Error in extractEntity if all the coded values to
  be extracted are NA when extracting Scoring Method.
- Error in extractCodes when extracting drug codelists.
- Consistent number of decimal places in percentConf
- Fixed a bug in addToCohort in selecting one row per
  patient
- extractCodes now works with product codelists

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-7
=================================================

TODO:

- Allow date column to be extracted as the value
  of interest using addToCohort (currently not
  possible if it has the same name as the event
  date column)
- Bug fix: Message for description states 'xx
  variable is not present' if adding to a ffdf cohort  

CHANGES:

- Allow column names to be included in exportTable
- Allow zero line position to be modified in multiforest

BUG FIXES:

- Tidied up the text sanitization in exportTable
- The package depends on xtable (for exportTable) but
  this was not listed as a dependency.

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-6
(fifth version on R-Forge)
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- extractCodes extracts all codes rather than only
  codes of interest when using ICD-10 codes, because
  of an error in the way categories are handled in
  mycodelist
- formathr no longer causes errors if se is missing
- date columns added to cohort description (addToCohort)

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-5
(fourth version on R-Forge)
=================================================

CHANGES:

- merge.cohort() now requires that both cohorts
  have the same ID column name.
- addToCohort, addCodelistToCohort and addCategoryToCohort
  have an additional argument limit_days for
  specifying time limits in days instead of years.

BUG FIXES:

- the idcolname attribute in cohort sometimes has
  a name, which it does not need, which means that
  it is not regarded as identical to an idcolname
  attribute in another cohort with the same value
  but no name. 

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-4
(third version on R-Forge)
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- fixed a bug in merge.cohort

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-3
(second version on R-Forge)
=================================================

NEW FEATURES:

- extractEntity allows extraction of more than one
  entity type
- extractCodes uses parallel execution for extracting
  ICD-10 codes
- 'cohort' object can be either ffdf or data.table
- convertDates works on ffdf objects
- setnames function for cohort, which also updates
  description table
- new function AddCategoryToCohort which allows the
  creation of binary variables from multiple records
  of categorical variables.

CHANGES:

- transferVariables uses the ID column of fromdata or
	todata (if either is a cohort) as the default 'by'
	variable.

BUG FIXES:

- summaryTable had an error when exporting to CSV, now
  fixed
- removeColumns would also delete the description table

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-2
=================================================
