=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-6
(fifth version on R-Forge)
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- extractCodes extracts all codes rather than only
  codes of interest when using ICD-10 codes, because
  of an error in the way categories are handled in
  mycodelist
- formathr no longer causes errors if se is missing
- date columns added to cohort description (addToCohort)

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-5
(fourth version on R-Forge)
=================================================

CHANGES:

- merge.cohort() now requires that both cohorts
  have the same ID column name.
- addToCohort, addCodelistToCohort and addCategoryToCohort
  have an additional argument limit_days for
  specifying time limits in days instead of years.

BUG FIXES:

- the idcolname attribute in cohort sometimes has
  a name, which it does not need, which means that
  it is not regarded as identical to an idcolname
  attribute in another cohort with the same value
  but no name. 

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-4
(third version on R-Forge)
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- fixed a bug in merge.cohort

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-3
(second version on R-Forge)
=================================================

NEW FEATURES:

- extractEntity allows extraction of more than one
  entity type

  ICD-10 codes
- 'cohort' object can be either ffdf or data.table
- convertDates works on ffdf objects
- setnames function for cohort, which also updates

CHANGES:

- transferVariables uses the ID column of fromdata or
	todata (if either is a cohort) as the default 'by'
	variable.

BUG FIXES:

- summaryTable had an error when exporting to CSV, now
  fixed
