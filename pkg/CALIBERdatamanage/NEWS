=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-14
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- with=FALSE together with := was deprecated in data.table
- Corrected error in summaryTable when data.table is
  specified as an argument, and clarified the documentation.

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-13
=================================================

CHANGES:

- xrange can be specified for each graph in multiforest
  input data. If only a single value is specified it
  is considered to be the maximum.

BUG FIXES:

- ensure that extractCodes does not return a codelist
- idcolname is considered identical even if it is a
  named character string in one cohort dataset and
  unnamed in another (ideally should be unnamed)
- character vectors converted to factor when using
  transferVariables
- summary.cohort and print.cohort use is.cohort to
  check that the object is a cohort (e.g. that it has
  valid idcolname)  
- Do not convert var.labels (from Stata) into description
  table if it is the wrong length
- Error when start and end of limit_days are the same
- 'Cohort' objects with invalid idcolname are stripped
  of their cohort class attribute by is.cohort
- All cohort methods use 'is.cohort' to perform a 
  deeper check whether an object is a valid cohort,
  rather than relying on the class attribute.
- Correction to box size calculation in multiforest --
  box area proportional to inverse variance.

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-12
=================================================

CHANGES:

- cohort() uses the variable labels from a Stata
  datset to create the column descriptions
- modifyDescription can be used on any matrix,
  data.frame or data.table

BUG FIXES:

- Corrected error in extractCodes with HES data and
  FFDF
- Corrected error in addToCohort which means that
  it does not work if the column to be extracted
  is the eventdate column when data is in ffdf format.
- merge.cohort produced an error when by was specified

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-11
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- Ensure that cohort remains a cohort when
  subsetting
- is.cohort checks for the existence of the idcolname
  attribute as well as the cohort class (to overcome
  situations where data.tables were modified and
  stripped of attributes but retained the cohort
  class)
- Corrected error in addToCohort which caused it
  to ignore many of the eligible rows in some situations.

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-10
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- Ensure that addToCohort works if there are some
  missing indexdates

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-9
=================================================

CHANGES:

- Box area instead of box width is now proportional
  to inverse variance in multiforest
- removeVariables added as an alias of removeColumns
- transferColumns added as an alias of transferVariables
- addCodelistToCohort can use ONS & HES (ICD-10 and OPCS)
  datasets
- overwrite is TRUE by default in both addToCohort and
  addCodelistToCohort (previously inconsistent)
- summary.cohort produces a neater display
- importDT and importFFDF clean up their temporary files

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-8
=================================================

CHANGES:

- No warning if unable to convert text to date (previously
  this would produce warnings with importDT because
  the function tries to convert every text column
  to date).
- Added decimal.mark as an argument to formatnum, to
  allow different options for decimal points.
- New arguments defaultboxcolour and defaultlinecolour
  for multiforest
- formatnum no longer gives warnings for missing values
- When transferring variables between cohorts,
  the description is also transferred
- transferVariables now has an option of 
  removing variables from the dataset they are
  transferred from
- importDT can now handle gzipped files (they are imported
	directly with read.table and fread = FALSE)
- date column can now be extracted as the value
  of interest using addToCohort (previously not
  possible if it had the same name as the event
  date column)

BUG FIXES:

- Error in extractEntity if all the coded values to
  be extracted are NA when extracting Scoring Method.
- Error in extractCodes when extracting drug codelists.
- Consistent number of decimal places in percentConf
- Fixed a bug in addToCohort in selecting one row per
  patient
- extractCodes now works with product codelists

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-7
=================================================

TODO:

- Allow date column to be extracted as the value
  of interest using addToCohort (currently not
  possible if it has the same name as the event
  date column)
- Bug fix: Message for description states 'xx
  variable is not present' if adding to a ffdf cohort  

CHANGES:

- Allow column names to be included in exportTable
- Allow zero line position to be modified in multiforest

BUG FIXES:

- Tidied up the text sanitization in exportTable
- The package depends on xtable (for exportTable) but
  this was not listed as a dependency.

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-6
(fifth version on R-Forge)
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- extractCodes extracts all codes rather than only
  codes of interest when using ICD-10 codes, because
  of an error in the way categories are handled in
  mycodelist
- formathr no longer causes errors if se is missing
- date columns added to cohort description (addToCohort)

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-5
(fourth version on R-Forge)
=================================================

CHANGES:

- merge.cohort() now requires that both cohorts
  have the same ID column name.
- addToCohort, addCodelistToCohort and addCategoryToCohort
  have an additional argument limit_days for
  specifying time limits in days instead of years.

BUG FIXES:

- the idcolname attribute in cohort sometimes has
  a name, which it does not need, which means that
  it is not regarded as identical to an idcolname
  attribute in another cohort with the same value
  but no name. 

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-4
(third version on R-Forge)
=================================================

BUG FIXES:

- fixed a bug in merge.cohort

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-3
(second version on R-Forge)
=================================================

NEW FEATURES:

- extractEntity allows extraction of more than one
  entity type
- extractCodes uses parallel execution for extracting
  ICD-10 codes
- 'cohort' object can be either ffdf or data.table
- convertDates works on ffdf objects
- setnames function for cohort, which also updates
  description table
- new function AddCategoryToCohort which allows the
  creation of binary variables from multiple records
  of categorical variables.

CHANGES:

- transferVariables uses the ID column of fromdata or
	todata (if either is a cohort) as the default 'by'
	variable.

BUG FIXES:

- summaryTable had an error when exporting to CSV, now
  fixed
- removeColumns would also delete the description table

=================================================
CALIBERdatamanage Version 0.1-2
=================================================

First version to be released on R-Forge. This is 
alpha software, not yet ready for production use.
